+==============================================================================+
  ntoll's fork is moving a lot faster than the code here, so it may be worth   
  checking out his fork at http://github.com/ntoll/JFluidDB
+==============================================================================+

This is a direct port of FluidDB.net ( http://github.com/ntoll/FluidDB.NET/tree/master )
by Nicholas Tollervey ( http://ntoll.org/ ) from C# to Java.

See the AUTHORS file for contributors.

See the TODO file for the next things to be implemented.

Unit tests (using jUnit http://www.junit.org/) can be found in the tests directory under 
src/com/fluidinfo/

To be able to run the unit tests you need to provide some valid credentials for the sandbox instance
of FluidDB. You can supply these by putting a credentials.json file in your home directory - the
test fixture will attempt to read this file and use the username and password defined therein. See the
credentials.json.example file for an example of the correct contents of this file.

This is still a very early stage, but any help is appreciated in getting this up and running in a more 
complete fashion.

Currently we have a class (FluidConnector) that facilitates interaction with FluidDB, a suite of tests
for this class and some other helper classes.

This is the minimum required for interaction with FluidDB. In the coming days I (ntoll) will add higher
level abstractions in the form of helper classes to make the API a lot easier to use. These changes will
also be reflected in the .NET version of this library.

All feedback, patches, bug-reports are most welcome!
